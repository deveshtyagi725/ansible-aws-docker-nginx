# íº€ Ansible + AWS EC2 + Docker + Nginx Deployment

This project showcases a fully automated deployment pipeline using **AWS EC2**, **Docker**, and **Nginx** to serve a custom HTML landing page â€” all built and deployed by me í¸Ž.

From spinning up the infrastructure to launching the application, everything was done using modern DevOps techniques and cloud-native tools.

## âš™ï¸ What I Did (Step-by-Step)

- âœ… Provisioned an EC2 instance on AWS  
- âœ… Configured Security Groups to open ports `22 (SSH)` and `80 (HTTP)`  
- âœ… SSHâ€™d into the instance using a `.pem` key  
- âœ… Installed Docker to handle container deployment  
- âœ… Deployed an Nginx container that serves a beautiful custom `index.html` landing page  
- âœ… Verified deployment with a live public IP
